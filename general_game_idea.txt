GENERAL GAME IDEA

Top-down shooter with melee combat

Gameplay:
Top down environment, set in a dead city or some sort of dungeon, with the goal of clearing monsters.
Player needs to carefully place shots, since the gun is slow-firing and has long reload times.
There is melee combat as an alternative, so that the game is not too harsh and stressful.

Lore:
Possibly Daemonsong spinoff set in Mawar Cradle, where the player is an Enforcer, who is tasked
with clearing a location overrun with Hollows (or Soulless maybe).

Game name: maybe... Fire and Hollows?
